```
What do I do:

- Read research papers like novels (or so I convince myself), try to implement them and usually end up debugging existential crises instead of code.

- Currently learning:  
    - CUDA (where ‘parallel computing’ means my code and my patience both crash at the same time.)

- Future plans:  
    - RL (Reinforcement Learning, or "Repeatedly Losing" depending on the day)
    - Mech Interp (Mechanistic Interpretability, aka "Staring at neural nets until they reveal their secrets or my sanity breaks")

- Workflow:  
    - Zed + Vim Motions = “Power moves, but my pinky finger always hurts”

Quote to live by:  
“If at first you don’t succeed, try reading the paper again or just blame CUDA.”
