```
What do I do:

- Read research papers like novels, try to implement them and usually end up debugging existential crises instead of code.

- Currently learning:  
    - RL (Reinforcement Learning, or "Repeatedly Losing" depending on the day)
    - Mech Interp (Mechanistic Interpretability, aka "Staring at neural nets until they reveal their secrets or my sanity breaks")

- Future plans:  
    - Inference optimization coming soon™  
      (translation: preparing to spend far too many nights with CUDA headaches and PyTorch rabbit holes)

- Workflow:  
    - Zed + Vim Motions = “Power moves, but my pinky finger always hurts”
---

“If at first you don’t succeed, try reading the paper again or just blame CUDA.”
